This section would contain what's in Section ``The contents of a geometric algebra" in \cite{chisolm2012geometric}, e.g. $r$-blades, $r$-vectors, before we can discuss anything about the GA operations.

That means we need to first formalize the counter parts in Clifford Algebra, e.g. Lipschitz Group, Spin Group, and Z-filteration in Clifford Algebra.

I'll take a stab at porting Jiale Miao's \href{https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16040}{mathlib\#16040} which seems to be a more principled attempt than \href{https://github.com/pygae/lean-ga/blob/master/src/geometric_algebra/from_mathlib/versors.lean}{versors in lean-ga} except for the part involving Z-filteration which is still worth porting, possibly with ideas from the prototype \href{https://github.com/eric-wieser/lftcm2023-clifford_algebra/}{here}.

First step is to port it with mathport, then fill in the only sorry \lstinline|invertible_of_invertible_Î¹|.
