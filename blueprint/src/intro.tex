The goal of this document is to provide a detailed account
of the formalization of Geometric Algebra (GA) a.k.a. Clifford Algebra \cite{hestenes2012clifford}
in the Lean 4 theorem prover and programming language \cite{moura2021lean, lean_2015}
and using its Mathematical Library \cite{themathlibcommunityLeanMathematicalLibrary2020}.
